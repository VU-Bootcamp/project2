## PRODUCT FEATURES

The application was made to help users to find outdoor areas to go an explore. The user will login or sign up and then they will be able to select one of the following pages; biking, climbing, hiking, or running. Once the user is on the selected page they can type in their zip code and find a trail to go explore. There will be 10 different trails listed along with the difficulty, a brief description, and a link to access more information.

## FUTURE DEVELOPMENT

In the future we would like to have all the following pages combined into one; biking, climbing, hiking, and running. We also would like to add the ability for users to leave reviews and recommendations.
